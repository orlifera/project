<p id="description">Small website made with Typescript and React using the Vite package. It's a project made to test my skills and use for the first time APIs and Helper files. It features a note section where you can add chunk of text via JSON (the ability to add them via GUI and not modifying the JSON each time is in the works); a Gallery that uses yet-another-react-lightbox; a watchlist that uses API Calls to TMDB to search and add movie to said watchlist (as of now its only LocalStorage); A wishlist that saves the wishes on a JSON files and updates it dynamically using GitHub as backend.</p>
